### What I learned

I learned how to use the composition API for VueJS. It was a great challenge and I hope to get really familiar with this framework and it's patterns.

### Continued development

I really need to focus on how to write cleaner jS. VueJS in particular is very easy to get started and there is tons of information online on how to write simple applications.

### Useful resources

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) - YouTube is always open and it's really easy to learn how other people approach code.
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - For this project I constantly went back to learn all the ins and out of Vue.
- [VueSchool.io](https://vueschool.io/) - For this project I constantly went back to learn all the ins and out of Vue.
